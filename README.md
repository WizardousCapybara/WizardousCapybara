        <h2>Who Am I? What Am I? Am I A Human Or A Peach?</h2>
        <p>
            Hi. I'm Alyssa, and this is my little corner of the internet where I share snippets from my life. Peach. It's a very fun and pleasing word. Also, I have my Gmail down there. I barely ever check it, so if you spam me, I probably won't notice. I don't know if I'll remember this website. I only made this because ChatGPT helped me lol. Beep beep.

        <h2>Random Depression</h2>
        <p>
            Life is full of surprises, and I love to hate surprises. I bet you do too. Anyways, I'm a depressed kid going into 7th grade. Maybe when I'm like 17 and rediscover this, I'll cringe. I don't know. 
        </p>
        <h2>Space Aesthetic</h2>
        <p>
            I'm probably going to die. I like space though. I need some too. Doesn't everyone nowadays? Space would be nice. I'm very tired. I'm actually always tired, haha.
